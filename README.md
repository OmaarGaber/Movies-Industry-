Movies Industry Analysis Project 

This Project is Related to Data Science and negotiate the analysis about it

One of the most important and best projects in which I had a very good experience The project talks about The Movies industry in general form  as we know movies industry is one of the most important industries ever , and the most lucrative one 

At the beginning, I would just like to say that the difficulty of this project was defining the features that I will work on , i will use a Machiene Learning  Model 
- this is a self improvment project thats why i faced a hard time in selecting the feature

- first step is imprting the libraries Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn , sklearn , sklearn.metrics , sklearn.linear_model
- after that exploring the data from the head , tail , num of columns , shape , detecting the num of nulls , the num of empties , the data types and CORR between data

- second step is data processing , dropping the null , removing the duplicates and replacing the np.nan 
and detecting the prc the null values of each column , allocating the numric values that i wanna confirm
- creating a numarized fun just to prepare the data to ente into the ML model
- detecting the out layers by making a box plot

- will find some visualisations
